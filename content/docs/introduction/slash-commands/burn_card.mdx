## About
It's important to remember that you can't burn a locked/event card.
However, you can burn a card even if you have a dupe.
Keep in mind that this action is irreversible, so think carefully before burning any cards during the game.  
This feature adds another layer of strategy, as players must weigh the benefits of burning a card against the potential impact on their overall game plan. 
Understanding the consequences of burning cards, we do not redo.

<p className="noteBox"><strong>Note:</strong> Even if you burn all of your card's rank, exp, and progress **WON'T BE GONE** and will remain intact!</p>
